                    <h3 class='topic-header'>Adult Changing Tables</h3>
                    <p>Adult changing tables are an indispensable aid to weakened or disable adults and their caregivers. For adults who manage mobility limitations or incontinence, they provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable space for assisted changing. For caregivers, they provide a secure and convenient platform that reduces the risk of back strain and other injuries.</p>
                    <p>Adult changing tables, also called nursing tables or nursing benches, are versatile tools that can be used to assist patients in changing clothes, incontinence aids, or bandages, as well as a number of other tasks. For this reason, they are a popular choice for a variety of venues, such as hospitals, assisted living homes, retirement communities, and private residences. While most adult changing tables are used for elderly patients, they are equally valuable to disabled adults, teens, and children. Moreover, patients themselves aren't the only beneficiaries of adult changing tables—their ease of use, sanitary design, and ergonomic features make adult changing tables appealing to caregivers as well.</p>
                    <p>Adult changing tables come in a variety of designs with a selection of features. Deciding which is right for you depends on the needs of your patients and your facility.</p>

                    <p><em>The flexibility of the nursing bench provides for optimal working conditions for the caregiver as well as a high level of comfort and safety for the disabled user.</em></p>

                    <h3 class='topic-header'>Types of Adult Changing Tables</h3>
                    <p><strong>Foldable Adult Changing Tables</strong></p>
                    <p>Caregivers have the option of purchasing power-folding adult changing tables or manual-folding adult changing tables, both of which are equipped with pneumatic cylinders that are integrated in the folding joints for quiet and smooth operation.</p>

                    <!-- image1 -->
                    <img src='/images/content/ACT-Pillar-Page/adult-changing-table-with-raised-section.jpg' alt='Pressalit Adult Changing Table with Flexible Raised Section'>
                    <p><em>Pressalit Care Adult Changing Table with flexible rasied section so patients head can be raised while caregiver is giving them a shower. Head can be raised when patient is getting a shower.</em></p>

                    <p>Foldable adult changing tables provide an equally durable changing station to non-folding tables, 
                    but can be safely and easily stowed away when not in use. For this reason, they are popular in homes and small facilities where floor space is limited. Non-folding adult changing tables are commonly 
                    used in hospitals and caregiving facilities where space is not usually an issue, and are best suited for constant use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Height-Adjustable Adult Changing Tables and Fixed-Height Adult Changing Tables</strong></p>
                    <p>Electrically height-adjustable adult changing tables are extremely beneficial in the care of disabled and elderly patients. With height-adjusted adult changing tables, caregivers can easily raise and lower the changing platform, creating a safer space for patients and minimizing the risk of injury for caregivers during transfers. Variable height changing tables are also more versatile: they can be adjusted to accommodate both patients and caregivers of different heights and sizes.</p>

                    <p>If a height-adjustable adult changing table doesn’t seem right for you, fixed height adult changing tables offer a great alternative and are perfect for patients who pose little to no risk of injuring themselves or the caregiver when getting on and off the table. Fixed-height tables work well for use by only one patient and/or caregiver where frequent adjustment is not necessary. Locations that accommodate multiple patients or caregivers will find adjustable height tables more convenient, as they can meet the needs of different body types and sizes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fixed Adult Changing Tables and Portable Adult Changing Tables</strong></p>
                    <p>Fixed adult changing tables are wall-mounted, and generally more convenient and secure than portable adult changing tables. They can be both fixed- or adjustable-height, and are ideal for frequent use.</p>
                    <p>Portable adult changing tables are better suited for homes and small facilities, where space and mobility are a concern. They are typically situated on sturdy and securable casters, or wheels, and have the added benefit of serving as a backup mobility stretcher in case of emergency.</p>

                    <p><strong>Adult Changing Table Safety Rails</strong></p>
                    <p>Safety rails provide an extra layer of security for disabled adults and their caregivers. They  can be the difference between keeping your patient safe on the table or injured on the ground. This additional safety feature can be added to both folding and non-folding units, and proves critical in minimizing risk to both your patient and you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sanitary Appliances for Adult Changing Tables</strong></p>
                    <p>Caregivers are also given the option of choosing an adult changing table equipped with special needs sanitary appliances such as washing stations with hot and cold taps, splashing curtains to protect the caregiver against splashing, water collection trays, and more.</p>

                    <p><strong>Patient Lift Systems</strong></p>
                    <p>For adults with exceptional mobility limitations, whose caregivers cannot safely move them to a comfortable surface, adult changing changing tables can be integrated with a ceiling-mounted patient lift system. These tools can save time and resources, and, most importantly, their secure and ergonomic capabilities greatly reduce the risk of injury for both caregivers and their patients.</p>

                        <h3>Who Uses Adult Changing Tables</h3>
                        <p>Adult changing tables can meet the needs of a diverse group of users with special needs or disabilities. Some users include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Adults and children with special needs.</strong> The convenience and safety of changing tables are ideally suited for adults and special needs children and students who can benefit from assisted changing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disabled/Handicapped Adults and Wheelchair users.</strong> Adults with mobility limitations and their caregivers find the versatility of adjustable changing tables especially convenient.</p>

                        <p><strong>Elderly Adults.</strong> Adult changing tables make ideal changing stations for elderly adults who need assistance with clothes or adult diaper changing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Caregivers.</strong> Disabled or elderly adults are not the only people who benefit from adult changing tables. These amenities are also designed with caregivers in mind. Their ergonomic design makes it as convenient as possible for a medical professional or loved one to provide assistance without causing back strain or other injury, while also being easy to clean.</p>

                    <h3 class='topic-header'>Facilities that Use Adult Changing Tables</h3>
                    <p>Because of their safety, convenience, and versatility, adult changing tables are used in a variety of facilities. They can be found in hospitals, long-term care facilities, assisted living homes, schools, and private residences.</p>
                    <p>Besides health care facilities and other locations that cater to special needs adults and children, more and more places of public accommodation are choosing to install adult changing tables to make their spaces more accessible. Entertainment venues such as movie theaters and stadiums have discovered that having adult changing tables make them more attractive to a clientele whose disabilities limit their recreation options. Venues that cater to a broad customer base, such as shopping malls, convention centers, and large retail stores, find that many of their patrons appreciate the convenience of adult changing tables on site. And locations that accommodate tourism-related traffic, such as airports and hotels, can increase their appeal to a segment of travelers whose needs are overlooked elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>One example of a location that has found the benefit of making adult changing tables available is the <a href='http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-bz-orlando-airport-adult-changing-tables-20170124-story.html' target='_blank'>Orlando International Airport</a>, which recently installed Pressalit adult changing tables with safety rails in two of its restrooms. Airports in Baltimore and Phoenix have made similar accommodations.</p>
                    <p>Finally, manufacturers are increasingly designing home-friendly adult changing tables to meet the needs of the Aging in Place movement. As more seniors choose to live independently into advanced age, they require more assistance in their own homes. An adult changing table in the home can make it easier for aging adults to continue living where they are most comfortable, and for in-home caregivers to provide the best assistance possible.</p>

                        <h3 class='topic-header'>The Benefits of Adult Changing Tables</h3>
                        <p>Adult changing tables are designed specifically for use by weakened or disabled adults and their 
                        caregivers. They have a number of advantages over beds or other surfaces that are not customized for ease of use.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adult changing tables are ergonomic</strong> They are designed to accommodate the natural movements of both patients and caregivers, to reduce the strain caused by unnecessary bending or maneuvering, and to facilitate ease of transfer for mobility-impaired patients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adult changing tables are sanitary.</strong> Their specially designed surfaces and features make for ease of cleaning and superior hygiene, whereas surfaces not designed for clean use can be less hygienic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adult changing tables are safe.</strong> They are designed to provide secure patient care, and optional features such as safety rails ensure that patients are safe in their use.</p>

                        <img src='/images/content/ACT-Pillar-Page/benefits-of-adult-changing-tables.jpg' alt='caregiver and patient'>

                        <p><strong>Adult changing tables have multiple uses and functions.</strong> As their name implies, adult changing tables are designed primarily to change a mobility impaired person's clothes, bandages, or incontinence aids. However, because of their sanitary and ergonomic design, they can also be used to bathe patients on an easily washed surface, or to provide many other kinds of health or comfort assistance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adult changing tables make people feel welcome.</strong> Restrooms in places of public accommodation have long featured baby changing tables, which parents find incredibly helpful during inconvenient moments. But the caregivers of children and adults who cannot use these tables are often forced to assist their patients or loved ones on the floor, which is unsanitary, unsafe, uncomfortable, and humiliating. Advocates for safe changing spaces have organized under the Universal Changing Places Movement to promote safe and sanitary changing environments for all persons. Having an adult changing table on premises is a great way to let elderly or disabled people know that you care about their needs.</p>

                    <h3 class='topic-header'>How to Choose the Right Adult Changing Table for You</h3>
                    <p>Different models of adult changing tables will have different benefits and uses depending on the environment and the needs of the user and caregiver. Facilities that have plenty of space, and a high volume of patients, will benefit from larger, non-foldable adult changing tables, whereas smaller facilities and homes, where space is limited, will benefit more from folding adult changing tables that are sized right for the patient or patients. Patients who have difficulty moving may prefer height-adjustable adult changing tables, as will caregivers with ergonomic requirements. Mobile adult changing tables are well suited for homes and small facilities, whereas fixed adult changing tables are more convenient for multiple uses and patients.</p>

                        <h3>Adult Changing Table FAQs</h3>
                        <p>Below is a list of frequently asked questions, and answers, about adult changing tables.</p>

                        <p><strong>Who can benefit from an adult changing table?</strong></p>
                        <p>Both patients and caregivers benefit when using an adult changing table. They reduce the risk of injury to caregivers who might strain their bodies trying to assist patients on less ergonomic surfaces, and they provide a comfortable, secure, and sanitary surface for patients. Adult changing tables are suitable for use in both public and private settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living centers, and rehabilitation clinics.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why can’t I just use a bed for changing my patients instead of an adult changing table?</strong></p>
                        <p>In most cases, an adult changing table is far better and safer for patient handling. Many of these nursing benches are height adjustable to help avoid lifting heavy patients and to reduce the need for awkward bending and maneuvering for the caretaker which can often cause injury. Additionally, adult changing tables are designed to be easy-to-clean for superior hygiene, and some models even have a built-in sink</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the benefits of a folding adult changing table?</strong></p>
                        <p>Foldable adult changing tables can be safely and easily stowed away when not in use to save space in high-traffic areas. All foldable adult changing tables provide the same durability and security of non-folding tables.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the benefits of an ergonomically designed changing table?</strong></p>
                        <p>Ergonomically designed adult changing tables can be electrically adjusted to any height for safe and secure transfers. This ergonomic design feature helps to prevent unnecessary injury and provides optimum comfort to both the patient and the caregiver.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the safety benefits of adult changing tables?</strong></p>
                        <p>Adult changing tables accommodate both the user and caregiver in order to eliminate any awkward straining or maneuvering that might cause injury, and they are designed for optimal cleanliness and hygiene. Additional safety features, such as safety rails or hygienic accessories, can be added to most adult changing tables.</p>

                        <img src='/images/content/ACT-Pillar-Page/adult-changing-table-faqs.jpg' alt='caregiver and patient'>

                        <p><strong>How Do I Clean an Adult Changing Table?</strong></p>
                        <p>Adult changing table surfaces are designed to be hygienic and easy to clean. They can be gently wiped with hot water or a mild cleaning solution. You should check with the manufacturer, however, for which solutions have been tested and approved for that model, as some solutions may damage the table's surface. Chlorine-based cleansers should not be used, nor should abrasive cleansers, as these could scratch or corrode the surface coating. Additionally, if a solution is used, you should gently wipe the surface with a clean rag dampened in clear, warm water after cleaning, in order to avoid staining, discoloring, or deteriorating the surface.</p>
                        <p><strong>Should I choose a fixed or mobile adult changing table?</strong></p>
                        <p>Fixed adult changing tables are generally more convenient and ergonomically accommodating, and good for multiple uses or patients. Mobile adult changing tables are better suited for small spaces and infrequent use.</p>
